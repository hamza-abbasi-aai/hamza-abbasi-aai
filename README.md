### 👋 Hi, I'm Hamza Abbasi

I’m a Principal Technical Architect building trusted AI systems for high-stakes domains like autonomous driving, compliance/homologation, and consumer-facing GenAI products.

I work across the full stack of modern AI systems, from RAG pipelines and fine-tuning to evaluation, backend services, and production deployment.

🔍 Currently focused on:
- Production RAG systems (LangChain, LangGraph) with strong grounding and traceability
- LLM evaluation pipelines (offline + online), including LLM-as-a-Judge and retrieval metrics (Precision@K, Recall@K)
- Fine-tuning workflows (LoRA, QLoRA) for domain-specific accuracy
- Scalable AI infrastructure and backend services for real-world products

🛠️ Tech Stack:
`Python` `C++` `FastAPI` `MongoDB` `PostgreSQL` `Apache Airflow`  
`LangChain` `LangGraph` `LangSmith` `Vector Search` `LoRA` `QLoRA`  
`Docker` `Kubernetes` `CI/CD` `GitHub Actions`  
`ROS` `OpenCV` `GCP` `AWS` `Vertex AI`
